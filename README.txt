Copy the server side to any IDE (I've used Intellij).

Copy the client side to Android Studio, where the java files go to src -> main -> java -> ... -> applicationa_name
the layout are to be placed in the res folder, as well as the font and drawables in place of the already existing folders (with such names).

First run the server side, then the client side. It is recommended choosing a wide screen phone to emulate (such as Medium Phone API 53).

Instructions on how to use the app are found in User Point of View file.
